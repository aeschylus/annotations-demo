  "readme": "# OpenSeadragon \n\nThis project is a fork of the OpenSeadragon project at http://openseadragon.codeplex.com/\n\n## On the Web\n\nhttp://openseadragon.github.io/\n\n## First Time Setup\n\nAll command-line operations are scripted using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) which is based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). To get set up:\n\n1. Install Node, if you haven't already (available at the link above)\n1. Install the Grunt command line runner (if you haven't already); on the command line, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`\n1. Clone the openseadragon repository\n1. On the command line, go in to the openseadragon folder\n1. Run `npm install`\n\nYou're set... continue reading for build and test instructions.\n\n## Building from Source\n\nTo build, just run (on the command line, in the openseadragon folder):\n\n    grunt\n\nIf you want Grunt to watch your source files and rebuild every time you change one, use:\n\n    grunt watch\n\nThe built files appear in the `build` folder.\n\nIf you want to build tar and zip files for distribution (they will also appear in the `build` folder), use:\n\n    grunt package\n\nNote that the `build` folder is masked with .gitignore; it's just for your local use, and won't be checked in to the repository.\n\nYou can also publish the built version to the site-build repository. This assumes you have cloned it next to this repository. The command is:\n\n    grunt publish\n\n... which will delete the existing openseadragon folder, along with the .zip and .tar files, out of the site-build folder and replace them with newly built ones from the source in this repository; you'll then need to commit the changes to site-build.\n\n## Testing\n\nOur tests are based on [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/); they're both installed when you run `npm install`. At the moment we don't have much in the way of tests, but we're working to fix that. To run on the command line:\n\n    grunt test\n\nIf you wish to work interactively with the tests or test your changes:\n\n    grunt connect watch\n\nand open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser\n\n## Contributing\n\nOpenSeadragon is truly a community project; we welcome your involvement!\n\nWhen contributing, please attempt to match the code style already in the codebase. Note that we use four spaces per indentation stop.
